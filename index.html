So what is data visualization? Data visualization is all about conveying engaging and vital data through concise and creative design practices. It combines the disciplines of statistics, graphics and graphical design, and computer science. Data visualization can take many forms through many types of technologies, but good data visualization is about telling the best story, in the right format, with the least amount of excess. For example, here we have a colorful, interactive representation of the daily schedules of famous writers and artists.

All presentations, be they scholarly or not, seek to convey some form of information to the audience. A good presenter can hold a listener's attention with inflections in their voice, shared anecdotes, and a well formatted speech or slides. A great presenter tells a story, and knows that the medium he or she uses to share that story will affect its delivery and overall success. Data visualization takes common datasets or statistics and puts them together in an aethetically appealing, informative way. Anyone familiar with spreadsheet software like Excel is probably used to long rows of miniscule characters and data points, as shown on the left. On the right, we have a similar dataset. While it may not show all the data listed in the excel spreadsheet on the left, it is more visual, is interactive, and generally does a better job of informing the audience.

Here we see an example of data visualization from the 1800s. This is John Snow's map of cholera cases in London, all of which he was able to trace back to one infected water pump in the neighborhood. This is not a new field, although the tools used within in it and the applications it has for scholars, libraries, and ordinary citizens have changed over the years. Early map-makers and visual artists, even cave painters, were using visuals to convey valuable information to others. In the 17th century, scholars like Galileo, measured time, distance, and space to map the stars and solve complex problems.<br />
The 19th century marked the beginning of modern graphics, with creators experimenting with new styles like bar and pie charts, line graphs, and atlases. The 19th century was considered a Golden Age of data visualization with innovative and successful styles being created and used by data visualizers from many disciplines. The 20th century began as a time of uniformity for data visualization, rather than a time of risk taking and innovation. However, today data visualization is booming again with an onslaught of design and technology innovations encouraging new trends and techniques in the field. Whereas data in meetings and ideas in classrooms may have once been perceived as boring or tedious, colorful pictures and maps spark interest in this type of information and help further comprehension. Now that data visualization is better understood, we may look at some tools/examples of the process.

There are many different tools one can use to create data visualizations because there are so many different types of data visualizations! In addition, advances in technology are allowing new and innovative techniques. Because of time constraints, in this presentation we have chosen to focus mostly on tools centered around data visualization and geography. Some data visualization softwares we recommend are: arcGIS, Leaflet, Tableau. These are all great tools and are available through UNC libraries

Here are some examples of our favorite geographic data visualizations that showcase strong design principles and accurate information portrayal. There’s no such thing as a perfect graph or map, because all observers are different. Not all data visualizations effectively convey information with good design practices. For our so-called “good example,” we have chosen a visualization of life expectancy in the US, gathered by the US Census and broken down by gender and county. This has a clear title and smaller headers for specific graphs, as well as emphasized numerical values for easy visibility. Differences in color gradient correspond with higher or lower life expectancy, and although counties and states are not labeled, an untrained eye may quickly perceive patterns and similarities and differences clustered around certain geographic points of interest. The state of Virginia is pulled out on the side to emphasize stats from Old Dominion, but is visualized in the exact same manner as the rest of the continental US.

For our “bad” example, we have selected the following file. Kelsey and I are not experts, but we did find a few problems with this visualization. Sure, it’s colorful and fun, but the viewer isn’t too sure of the information being conveyed here. Without a title, a little research was required to discover that this is a map of commonly traveled air routes around the world. With a bit of guesswork and geographical knowledge, certain airports and hubs can be identified, but the addition of a legend that details names, places, or size would still be more helpful. The use of a rainbow color scheme makes for general aesthetic beauty, but since the colors bleed into one another it’s not clear whether or not specific colors stand for airports in specific continents.

Interested in Data Viz now? Want to know about the cool stuff we have here at UNC? UNC-Chapel Hill has many resources available to help with Data Visualization. Davis Library houses the Research Hub. The Research Hub offers help with research presentation and GIS, and is home to several geography, GIS, and data visualization librarians. The Undergraduate Library is home to the Design Lab which offers design classes, consultation, and equipment -- some specifically for data visualization. UNC-Chapel Hill also have access to Lynda.Com, a website with thousands of tutorials for technology, design, and other practical skills - including data visualization and software like InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator which you might use to build your data visualizations.
