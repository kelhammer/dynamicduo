Data visualization is all about conveying engaging and vital data through concise and creative design practices. 
It combines the disciplines of statistics, graphics and graphical design, and computer science.
Data visualization can take many forms through many types of technologies, but good data visualization is about telling the best story, 
in the right format, with the least amount of excess. 
For example, here we have a colorful, interactive representation of the daily schedules of famous writers and artists.

All presentations, be they scholarly or not, seek to convey some form of information to the audience. 
A good presenter can hold a listener's attention with inflections in their voice, shared anecdotes, and a well formatted speech or slides.
A great presenter tells a story, and knows that the medium he or she uses to share that story will affect its delivery and overall success.
Data visualization takes common datasets or statistics and puts them together in an aethetically appealing, informative way.
Anyone familiar with spreadsheet software like Excel is probably used to long rows of miniscule characters and data points, as shown on the left.
On the right, we have a similar dataset. While it may not show all the data listed in the excel spreadsheet on the left,
it is more visual, is interactive, and generally does a better job of informing the audience.
